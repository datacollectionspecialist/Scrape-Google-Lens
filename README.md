# Scrape-Google-Lens
Learn how to scrape Google Lens results effortlessly using Scrapeless. Follow our step-by-step guide to extract image search data without coding!
## What is Google Lens?
Google Lens is an application based on artificial intelligence and image recognition technology that can identify objects, text, landmarks and other content through the camera or pictures, and provide relevant information.
## Is it legal to scrape data from Google Lens?
Scraping Google Lens data is not illegal, but there are various legal and ethical guidelines that need to be followed. Users must understand Google's Terms of Service, data privacy laws, and intellectual property rights to ensure their activities are compliant. By following best practices and staying informed about legal developments, you can minimize the risk of legal issues associated with web scraping.

## Challenges in Scraping Google Lens

- Advanced anti-bot technology: Google monitors network traffic patterns. Large numbers of repetitive requests from crawlers can be quickly detected, leading to IP bans, which stop the crawling process.
Recommended reading: Anti-Bot: What Is It and How to Avoid It
- JavaScript - rendered content: Much of the data for Google Lens is dynamically generated by JavaScript, which is inaccessible to traditional crawlers, requiring the use of headless browsers such as Puppeteer or Selenium, but this increases complexity and resource consumption.
- CAPTCHA protection: Google uses CAPTCHA to authenticate human users. Crawlers may encounter CAPTCHA challenges that are difficult to solve programmatically.
- Frequent website updates: Google regularly changes the structure and layout of Google Lens. The crawling code can quickly become outdated, and the XPath or CSS selectors used for data extraction may stop working. Constant monitoring and updates are required.
## Step Guide to Scrape Google Lens with Python
### Step 1. Configure the environment

- Python: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" rel="nofollow"><strong>The software </strong></a>is the core of running Python. You can download the version we need from the official website as shown below. However, it is not recommended to download the latest version. You can download 1.2 versions before the latest version.

![Python](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/scrape-google-lens/cebac66fa002962ef19d31428c9dc682.png)

- Python IDE: Any IDE that supports Python will work, but we recommend PyCharm. It is a development tool specifically designed for Python. For the PyCharm version, we recommend the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/" rel="nofollow"><strong>free PyCharm Community Edition</strong></a>

![Python IDE](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/scrape-google-lens/c021fbab4e71ab3037b63fda1830eaa4.png)


> **Note:** If you are a Windows user, do not forget to check the "Add python.exe to PATH" option during the installation wizard. This will allow Windows to use Python and commands in the terminal. Since Python 3.4 or later includes it by default, you do not need to install it manually.



![install python](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/scrape-google-lens/52376d4594301a7a8f82cb449470cdd1.png)


Now you can check if Python is installed by opening the terminal or command prompt and entering the following command:

```
python --version
```
### Step 2. Install Dependencies
It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal and execute the following command to create a virtual environment named google_lens:
```
python -m venv google_lens

```
Activate the virtual environment based on your system:

  Windows:
  ```
google_lens_env\Scripts\activate

```
  MacOS/Linux:
  ```



source google_lens_env/bin/activate
```
After activating the virtual environment, install the required Python libraries for web scraping. The library for sending requests in Python is requests, and the main library for scraping data is BeautifulSoup4. Install them using the following commands:
```

pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install playwright
```
### Step 3. Scrape Data
Open Google lens(https://www.google.com/?olud) in your browser and search for "https://i.imgur.com/HBrB8p0.png". Below is the search result:
![Scrape Data](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/scrape-google-lens/11805a965723c9472113f15f0a6ee705.png)
**Scrape title and image info**
![Scrape title and image info](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/scrape-google-lens/7905cad9c97bdc6c01ec2f68a9895346.png)

Some images are encoded in base64, while others are linked via HTTP，eg:
![](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/scrape-google-lens/183f5da31a59b9b1c1b1cc46aa33a72a.png)
![](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/scrape-google-lens/6456dbd0e6e3eab45633345c11bc9d25.png)
The code for obtaining title and image information is as follows：
```
# Store lens information in a dictionary
img_info = {
    'title': item.find("span").text,
    'thumbnail': item.find("img").attrs['src'],
}

```
Since we need to scrape all the data on the page, not just one, we need to loop through and scrape the above data. The complete code is as follows:
```
import json

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright


def scrape(url: str) -> str:
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        # Launch the browser and disable some features that may cause detection
        browser = p.chromium.launch(
            headless=True,
            args=[
                "--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled",
                "--disable-dev-shm-usage",
                "--disable-gpu",
                "--disable-extensions",
            ],
        )
        context = browser.new_context(
            user_agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/132.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
            bypass_csp=True,
        )
        page = context.new_page()
        page.goto(url)
        page.wait_for_selector("body", state="attached")
        # Wait for 2 seconds to ensure that the page is fully loaded or rendered
        page.wait_for_timeout(2000)
        html_content = page.content()
        browser.close()
    return html_content


def main():
    url = "https://lens.google.com/uploadbyurl?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FHBrB8p0.png"
    html_content = scrape(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
    # Obtain the main data of the page
    items = soup.find('div', {'jscontroller': 'M3v8m'}).find("div")
    # circular assembly
    assembly = lens_info(items)
    # Save results to a JSON file
    with open('google_lens_data.json', 'w') as json_file:
        json.dump(assembly, json_file, indent=4)


def lens_info(items):
    lens_data = []
    for item in items:
        # Store lens information in a dictionary
        img_info = {
            'title': item.find("span").text,
            'thumbnail': item.find("img").attrs['src'],
        }
        lens_data.append(img_info)
    return lens_data


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```
### Step 4. Output Results

A file named google_lens_data.json will be generated in your PyCharm directory. The output is as follows(Partial example):
```
[
  {
    "title": "Danny DeVito - Wikipedia",
    "thumbnail": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAkGBxAQEhAQEBAQEB
  },
  {
    "title": "Devito Danny Royalty-Free Images, Stock Photos & Pictures | Shutterstock",
    "thumbnail": "https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSO6Pkv_UmXiianiCh52nD5s89d7KrlgQQox-f-K9FtXVILvHh_"
  },
  {
    "title": "DATA | Celebrity Stats | Page 62",
    "thumbnail": "https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ9juRVpW6sjE3OANTKIJzGEkiwUpjCI20Z1ydvJBCEDf3-NcQE"
  },
  {
    "title": "Danny DeVito, Grand opening of Buca di Beppo italian restaurant on Universal City Walk Universal City, California - 28.01.09 Stock Photo - Alamy",
    "thumbnail": "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQq_07f-Unr7Y5BXjSJ224RlAidV9pzccqjucD4VF7VkJEJJqBk"
  }
]


```
